  "projectsExcerpt": "Instead of only showcasing my latest work, I've chosen four projects from the beginning and current stage of my learning. By showcasing early efforts like the Google Calendar clone, I am in no way trying to represent my current skillset, but rather, who I am as a developer, and who I continue to strive to be - someone who will output high quality work, regardless of whether or not they have the immediate knowledge to do so. If you are only interested in my current skillset, the Next.js Blog and Monthpicker Plugin are my two most recent projects.",
  "skillsExcerpt": "I believe in the principle that form follows function. A stellar user experience should arise from meticulously planned functionality, and similarly, well-conceived functionality can lead to great user experience. My strengths lie in developing and refining this functionality. I've prioritized building a robust foundation in fundamental web technologies and have utilized modern frameworks to enhance that foundation."
