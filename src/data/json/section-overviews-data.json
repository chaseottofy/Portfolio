  "projects": "I've chosen four projects from both the beginning and current stage of my learning. By including early works like the Google Calendar Clone, I am in no way trying to showcase the quality of code, but rather, who I am as a developer, and my consistency in delivering high quality work, regardless of whether or not I have the immediate knowledge to do so.",
  "skills": "My skills as a front-end web developer are a reflection of my relentless effort to push the very basics of web technologies to their limits. I made a conscious decision early to build a foundation that will last, and after two years of daily effort, I began to utilize modern frameworks and libraries like React, Typescript, and Next.js. Although I only have a year and a half of experience with these technologies, I have never felt disadvantaged when working with them, they have only enhanced my ability to build robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications."
