				"Note that this is not traditional markdown. I've kept things limited to purely what I find useful/use most of the time.",

Aside from avoiding potential security risks, delivering content through an actual react element raises performance significantly. Using setDangerousHtml & then performing HTML sanitation goes against every core principle of react's reconciliation process."
