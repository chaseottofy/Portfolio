				"Note that this is not traditional markdown. I've kept things limited to purely what I find useful/use most of the time.",
				"Markdown expressions are rendered/represented as react elements. Aside from avoiding potential security risks, delivering content through an actual react element raises performance significantly. Using setDangerousHtml & then performing HTML sanitation goes against every core principle of react's reconciliation process."
