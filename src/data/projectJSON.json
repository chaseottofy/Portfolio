It also incorporates a dynamic numbered line system (similar to notepad++), along with three contrast-accessible themes, local storage, and a file upload/download system.",
        "Note that this is not traditional markdown. I've kept things limited to purely what I find useful/use most of the time.",
        "Markdown expressions are rendered/represented as react elements. Aside from avoiding potential security risks, delivering content through an actual react element raises performance significantly. Using setDangerousHtml & then performing HTML sanitation goes against every core principle of react's reconciliation process."
